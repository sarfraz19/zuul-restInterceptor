zull netflix :
==============

-> JVM based router & multiple load balancer 

JVM based router - if we have lots of microservice then if the request is coming, then its needs to get filtered and 
sent to the target microservice, it is taken care by zuul

purpose :
instead of having lots of urls the purpose of the api gateway is to reduce the number of links such that 
confusion is less 

eg.
if we have 3 urls 
1) oc-web.mig.com/diaganostics 
2) pc-web.mig.com/doctor-api
3) olst-web.mig.com/patient

then using api-gateway we can make all the above links unified so if we have a api gateway eg. "api-gateway.com"
then api-gateway.com/diagnositics will lead to (1) url similarly for the other two urls 

flow diagram: 
============

http request --> pre-filters --> route-filters --> post-filters  -----> http response 
				   |		     |
				   |		     |
				    -----------> error-filters 

microservice interact between req & response 

pre-filter   - it filters to which service we need to send the request 
route-filter - it routes to the microservice 
post-filter  - it filter to which service we need to send the response 
error-filter - it filters out the errors

Rest interceptor :
==================

main difference is that, the rest interceptor and the filters can be used any where. where as for other
types it can be used in websocket layer only 


-> the purpose of the restInterceptor is to make the basic call a single class 
-> then if we need to call a specific service multiple times then we can use that single class to call the 
services
-> centralized is very usefull and thus it becomes more helpfull

intercept means - இடைமறிப்பு (obstruct (someone or something) so as to prevent them from continuing 
to a destination.)

interceptor uses :
================
-> Request and response logging
-> Retrying the requests with a configurable back off strategy
-> Request denial based on certain request parameters
-> Altering the request URL address
